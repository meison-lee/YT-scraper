# YT-scraper

Using React in frontend flask in backend

I am a dancer from Taiwan, I work on this project to create an app for me to analyse different dancer on YT. So I started by the scaper.py file, which will fetch videos depends on the searched topic and create some taking notes feature.

what I learn from this project
1. YT Data API
2. basic frontend by React
3. basic flask
4. selecting which DB I am going to use and whether to use the SQLAlchemy ORM. Also choosing where to host my DB(I host it on Azure flexible server for Postgres)
5. keep going on now
